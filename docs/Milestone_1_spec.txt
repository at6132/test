Technical Specification:

File Structure:
- Create a new directory for the project.
- Inside the project directory, create a folder named "database".

Database Setup:
- Install MongoDB on your machine.
- Start the MongoDB server.
- Connect to the MongoDB server using the MongoDB shell or a MongoDB client.
- Create a new database named "mydatabase".

Database Schema:
- Define the necessary collections and fields within the "mydatabase" database.
  - Example: 
    - Collection: users
      - Fields: 
        - id (unique identifier)
        - name
        - email
        - password

API Endpoints:
- Create API endpoints to interact with the MongoDB database.
  - Example:
    - GET /api/users - Retrieve all users from the "users" collection.
    - POST /api/users - Create a new user in the "users" collection.
    - GET /api/users/:id - Retrieve a specific user by ID from the "users" collection.
    - PUT /api/users/:id - Update a specific user by ID in the "users" collection.
    - DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete a specific user by ID from the "users" collection.

Database Connection:
- Implement a connection module to establish a connection to the MongoDB database from the application.
- Use a MongoDB driver (e.g., mongoose for Node.js) to interact with the database.

Testing:
- Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of the database operations and API endpoints.
- Test database connectivity, data retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion operations.

Documentation:
- Document the database schema, API endpoints, and database connection setup for reference.
- Include instructions on how to set up the project, install dependencies, and run the application.

Deployment:
- Deploy the application with the MongoDB database to a server for production use.
- Set up environment variables for database configuration to ensure security and flexibility.
